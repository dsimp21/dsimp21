As a longtime remote worker with over 10 years experience in different fields such as Graphic Design, Video Editing, Web Design and Customer Service, I believe that I can bring valuable contributions to your team.
Open-mindedness and attention to details are my strong suit. A strong desire to learn new things and approach challenges head on drives my motivation. My unique working history has given me a complete outlook in dealing with customers and clients of all kinds.
My successes have stemmed from essential skills, including customer service, client management and quality assurance and control. Recently, I have enhanced my customer service abilities, adding chat support and tier 2 agent support experience from my previous work with Sitel on their TurboTax project. I am a collaborative team player who is always searching for opportunities to impart valuable insights. With these qualities, I am able to facilitate positive change and impacting outcomes.

For a greater presentation of my background and qualifications, please review my resume below. I am eager to speak with you and greatly appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely, Dominick Simpson
